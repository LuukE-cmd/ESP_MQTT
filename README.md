## This is a school project using the esp-idf framework with an esp32 development board.

# Function
Connect to wifi and send temperature, humidity and wind speed to an MQTT broker.

# Info
This code is a first attempt, and mostly a learning experience. For this reason the project is only written in one file and are most lines commented.
A lot of descisions are based on learning concepts, not efficiency or maintainability.
